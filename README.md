# blog-website

This is a daily blog website where you can compose and write your own blogs.

The '/compose' takes you to the compose page where you can write the title and content of your blog and publish it on the main page.

The main page will slice the blogs to 100 words and you can click on "Read More" which will take you to the fresh page of that blog.

It also uses MongoDB to store data as seen in hyper terminal.

There are "/about" "/contact" pages as well on the site.
